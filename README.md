# GitHub Copilot Agent Test - Todo List

This project is an initial test using **GitHub Copilot Agent in VS Code**.

The goal was to create a **Todo List** with the following pages:
- Landing Page
- Login
- Register
- Settings
- Task List

> ⚠️ **No backend integration yet.**

---

## Notes

- The code was generated without manual intervention.
- The result looks "okay" when accessed, but it's **not something I'm proud of yet**.
- The main objective of this test was to **evaluate where we currently stand in terms of frontend development using Copilot Agent**.
- Although the UI looks decent, the project **still requires improvements and ongoing attention** to reach a solid and scalable state.

---

## Next Steps

- Review component structure and layout.
- Add backend integration.
- Assess code quality and best practices.
